The Security Council takes the lead in determining the existence of danger. There is scientific consensus that the Earth\'s climate is changing due to global warming caused mainly by humans. Climate change has the potential to worsen existing tensions or builds new ones and serving as a threat multiplier. It is the defining issue of our time and we are at a defining moment.

export const UNODC =
  "To create the world a safer place and help the United Nations in better addressing a coordinated, comprehensive response to the interrelated problems that have become global threats like trafficking in and abuse of drugs, international terrorism and political corruption, the UNODC was established two decades ago. For large-scale threats that states can’t handle alone, UNODC offers assistance and action that is just and practical. In maritime navigation, piracy has always been a regular problem since it is only the extension of the act of taking another’s properties by force. Nowadays piracy is still an issue all over the globe. Maritime crime involves the hijacking of petrochemical vessels and attacks on petroleum storages. The Indian Ocean faces many security challenges as it is one of the world's most active maritime routes and therefore, is also used as a platform for numerous maritime crimes and piracy. More than 80% of the world’s goods are transported by sea. A secure maritime atmosphere is crucial for the easy run of global trade. United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime has an indispensable role to perform in mainstreaming its criminal justice and security mandates as it acts as the guardian of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime."

export const UNCSW =
  'In the wake of progress around the globe, it is necessary to ensure that all citizens march at the same pace. The UN-CSW committee is the one that promotes gender equality and checks on women empowerment. In countries where traditions promote discrimination, this committee takes care of women’s rights. Traditionally it was established to put an end to the prevalent discrimination in many nations in the name of religious laws. But, with as the time progressed, the agendas of CSW became more broad and focused also on developing ecosystems that not only gives equal rights to both genders, but also offers them opportunities to exploit their rights equally. The simulation of CSW committee at JECRC MUN has so far explored the challenging notions of role of men and boys in gender equality, the need for women empowerment, and many such. This edition’s agenda aims at establishing checks and measures against the allowances being made for women, so that the rules don’t become unfair to the male gender. Also, the main aim is not bringing women forward, rather having them come at par with men. This is to be achieved not by force or farce, but with the help of fair resources and infrastructures. JECRC MUN 2020 is simulating the ideal committee for feminists and gender equality volunteers who can get a stage to talk about the change they wish to see.'

export const WHO =
  'The WHO is an agency of United Nations entrusted with the responsibility to maintain international public health. It monitors the standards of health and living as per the global population and directs programs to help nations strengthen their healthcare services. Many countries have not been able to support its citizens and offer healthcare as one of the basic amenities of life. WHO attempts to bridge this gap between the developed nations and third-world countries! Amidst the current crisis the world is facing with outbreaks of several communicable diseases in various parts of world, the WHO has to work with more conviction. Also, one part of the world is under the impact of severe malnutrition and under-nourishment of its population, while another is struggling with obesity. All these uneven conditions make the work of WHO, all the more challenging. Medication, population control, access to safe living conditions, and pollution are some of the prime concerns of this face of United Nations at the moment. However, this is the beginning of simulation of World Health Organization as a committee at JECRC MUN. In current scenario, it is impossible to ignore the health repercussions and how a country chooses to ensure the well-being of its residents. Also, since globalization is trending, it is the moral duty of any country to help another wage a war against the diseases crippling the population. Thus, the agenda of WHO deals with the crisis world faced during the outbreak of Ebola virus in Africa.'

export const AIPPM =
  "The All India Political Parties Meet is a powerful committee which imitates political realities by stimulating the multiple levels of policy existing in the country. Unrestricted political debate is accomplished without the interference of legislative rules. This committee will give a platform where several political personalities come together to debate and make the decisions on the matters of national importance. Democracy stands out as the most widely approved form of government among most of the nations. A strong opposition is one of the requirements for a healthy democracy in the country. The politics of the nation has been continuously developing, initially from one-party dominance to currently the coalition politics. Presently, the government is getting backlash from many people and activists throughout the country against their policy-making since the country’s economy hasn’t been this bad in 42 years. The AIPPM is a committee involving consensus of the members that participate in discussions and come to conclusions. It also requires the members to be aware of their and as well as other's identities' associations and ideology. It is an exciting and challenging committee as unlike other traditional MUN committees, as there can be heated debates among participants, cross-talks and high levels of negotiating actions and political democracy."
